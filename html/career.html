					<h1> Leon </h1>


							<p>In 2009 I decided to join an Erasmus Program in Leon, city in the north and cold region of Castilla Leon where I study Tourism and learn how to speak Spanish. During this period I study with over 300 students from all continents of the world and I had an unique opportunity to experience to study and work in a worldwide community. By that time, I was very positive that an internal experience could have a positive impact in my career and looking back now, I'm happy to see I was right. </p>

During this period I had an opportunity to visit Amsterdam for the first time, when I got to know even more the potential and the size of Booking.com and made me to chase an opportunity in the HQ.Also in Barcelona I had the opportunity to get very close friends, which turns out that today pretty much most of them have re allocated to Amsterdam.</p>
